# GloSAT LATsdb Data Source Codes

GloSAT LATsdb uses the same two-digit Data Source Codes that were used by CRUTEM5.0.
A Data Source Code is provided for each station in the database, to indicate where the data for a station was obtained from.

> [!NOTE]
> Only an overall source code is given for each station, which indicates the dominant source.
> For some stations, all values will have come from that single source.
> For other stations, values will have come from multiple sources, and the overall source code just indicates the dominant source.

The CRUTEM 2-digit Data Source Code table gives details about each Data Source Code. It is provided in three formats (text, csv and tsv).

In each case, the columns are:

 - Data source code
 - Data source name
 - Geographical region where the data are from
 - Description of the data source
 - Reference for the data source (where available)
 - URL or similar link for the data source (where available, note that we cannot guarantee that third parties will maintain their URLs or sites)
 - Homogeneity indicator (a broad-brush judgement of whether the data provider carried out a homogeneity assessment)
 - Start year of data for which homogenization may have been undertaken (if this is known)
 - End year of data for which homogenization may have been undertaken (if this is known)
 - Further comments about any homogenization that may have been applied to the data
 
For an explanation of the Homogeneity Indicators, see the [main README.md](../README.md).
